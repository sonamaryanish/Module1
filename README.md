As a culminating project, you'll be working with a dataset from ABC company, consisting of 458 rows and 9 columns. The company requires a comprehensive report detailing information about their employees across various teams. Your tasks include preprocessing the dataset, analyzing the data, and presenting your findings graphically. Here's a breakdown of what you need to do:

**Preprocessing**: 
● Correct the data in the "height" column by replacing it with random numbers between 150 and 180. Ensure data consistency and integrity before proceeding with analysis.

**Analysis**: 
● Determine the distribution of employees across each team and calculate the percentage split relative to the total number of employees. 
● Segregate employees based on their positions within the company. 
● Identify the predominant age group among employees.
● Discover which team and position have the highest salary expenditure. 
● Investigate if there's any correlation between age and salary, and represent it visually. 

**Graphical Representation:**
● For each of the five analysis tasks above, create appropriate visualizations to present your findings effectively. 
● Data Story: Provide insights gained from the analysis, highlighting key trends, patterns, and correlations within the dataset.
